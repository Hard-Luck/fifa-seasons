# require updates

## TS fixes

- dont use any

## usability

- i cant input numbers because it defualts to 0 and doesnt allow it to be deleted
- all the unputs for each game should be part of one form
- goals doesnt need a manual unput as we can see that from the score
- some stats aren't recording to the lifetime stats
- all additional inputs should be in a two column table with player1 and player2
